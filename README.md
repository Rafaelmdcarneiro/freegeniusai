# FreeGenius AI

FreeGenius AI is an ambitious project sparked by the pioneering work of [LetMeDoIt AI](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit). It's designed with the primary objective of offering a comprehensive suite of AI solutions that mirror the capabilities of [LetMeDoIt AI](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit). However, FreeGenius AI is remarkably different in that all core features are completely free, and it doesn't require the use of an OpenAI key.

As with [LetMeDoIt AI](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit), FreeGenius AI is designed to be capable of engaging in intuitive conversations, executing codes, providing up-to-date information, and performing a wide range of tasks. It's designed to learn, adapt, and grow with the user, offering personalized experiences and interactions.

# Goals

The author aims to equip FreeGenius AI, as an AI suite that is able to:

- support both offline and online backends
- support local LLM backends
- support open-source large language models
- support optional, but not required, OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini Pro API keys
- support current LetMeDoIt AI equivalent features
- devlops strategies plugin framework to execute multi-step generation or task execution
- run on average consumer hardware

# Supported LLM Interface / Models

FreeGenius AI supports four interfaces: llamcpp, ollama, gemini, and chatgpt. It also maintains backward compatibility with LetMeDoIt AI in LetMeDoIt Mode. The configuration of the LLM Interface is determined by the value of config.llmInterface, which defaults to 'llamacpp'.

* llamacpp - [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) / [Hugging Face models](https://huggingface.co/) + [Ollama Hosted models](https://ollama.com/library)

* ollama - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) / [Ollama Hosted models](https://ollama.com/library)

* groq - [Groq cloud api and model](https://console.groq.com/keys) / [Groq Hosted models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)

* gemini - [Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) / [Gemini Pro & Gemini Pro Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models)

* chatgpt - [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) / [ChatGPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)

* letmedoit - [LetMeDoIt mode](https://github.com/eliranwong/freegenius/wiki/LetMeDoIt-Mode) / [ChatGPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)

## Open Source Models on Consumer Hardware

Even on CPU-only devices, FreeGenius AI works well with a wide range of tested LLMs, particularly [wizardlm2:7b](https://ollama.com/library/wizardlm2). Download [ollama](https://ollama.com/) so that you may select open source LLMs easily via FreeGenius AI prompt.

Note: Ollama hosted models work with both "llamacpp" and "ollama" interfaces.

## GPU Acceleration

[AMD GPUs](https://github.com/eliranwong/freegenius/wiki/FreeGenius-with-AMD-GPU-Acceleration)

[Nvidia GPUs](https://github.com/eliranwong/freegenius/wiki/FreeGenius-with-Nvidia-GPU-Acceleration)

## What to Expect During the Initial Launch?

https://github.com/eliranwong/freegenius/wiki/Initial-Launch

## Download for Offline Use

FreeGenius AI can work with downloaded LLMs without internet. Upon the initial launch of FreeGenius AI, it will automatically download all necessary LLMs for core features and configure them for your convenience.

Additional featured models are automatically downloaded based on specific feature requests. For instance, the Whisper model is automatically downloaded for offline use when users request the transcription of an audio file.

## Install Ollama

This is optional. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to use [Ollama models](https://ollama.com/library) with either Llama.cpp or Ollama.
